Podcasts have been on the rise in the recent years, particulary since smart devices and connectivity have enabled folks to listen on the go.  I frequently listen to podcasts, ranging from Data Science, Design, Innovation & Strategy, and Philisophy.  I have been collecting a few of the resources, and have published them [here](https://github.com/akamlani/akamlani.github.io/wiki/Podcasts).  These are relatively easy listening casts that are great to listen on the go, in the background, or for inspiration.  Some of these publish show notes for further details as mentioned in the according episode, and a few of them even have [Slack](http://www.slack.com) channels.

One my favorite podcast episodes on the [Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/), was a podcast with [Naval Ravikant](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/30/naval-ravikant-on-happiness-hacks/), on Happiness hacks and the 5 Chimps Theory.  Who are your 5 Chimps?
