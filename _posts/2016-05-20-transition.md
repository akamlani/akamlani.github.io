summary: My move from Paris back to San Francisco
---


In the summer of 2015, I decided to transition my career from pure technology domain to datascience.  In September, I moved to Paris, France to attend a startup called [DSTI](https://www.datasciencetech.institute/).  After a few months of attending the school and working at [INRIA Research Institute](https://team.inria.fr/stars/) on Computer Vision, I decided to return to San Francisco and enroll in one of my previous top selections [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/) to finish off my studies for the time being.

The programs are quite different from one another, DSTI from a more research academic aspect and Galvanize from a more practical immersive experience.  The program at DSTI is a 2-year part-time program, such that it can be balanced between work experience and academic study.  They have since changed some of their timeline structure, but it was a nice idea in theory as a start-up.  Galvanize has a better track record, with already running 14 data science cohorts at the San Francisco location.

I would definitely say it was a learning experience moving abroad and learning about the different culture practices and executions.  While I didn't quite acquire my technical goal abroad, you can't put a price on life lessons learned.
