   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;flexible chair assignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was at a restaurant with a large group of colleagues.  Restaurants, Bars and social scenes are not advantageous for fixed seatings with large groups.  How do you engage with folks a few seats down.  The most likely response is that you don't or it requires some physical action on your part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a twist on this could be a new form of seating arrangements combined with some flooring infrastructure.  Imagine the chair would move or swivel to the desired location based on a patron indication (a button push).  This probably wouldn't be ideal for every social atmosphere settings and requires some form of infrastructure, but it would be an interesting model.  At the very least, it would be a unique feature to stand out for some vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
