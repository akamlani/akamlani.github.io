   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Searching within online video frames to determine the occurence of a query or event is still very difficult.  The methods utilized to perform this vary.  For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blinkx.com/corporate/about/technology&quot;&gt;Blinkx&lt;/a&gt; uses speech recognition to process audio, visual analysis for images, and metatags are indexed and extracted for further textual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the content is specific to curated content that can be identified by unique time synchronized fingerprints based on the event, so it is not live streaming content or generallized to pre-recorded content.  So YouTube videos consisting of educational videos or lectures would not be a use case, which is commonly needed.  This is one reason perhaps why the MOOC models have separated the content into snippets based on specific topics in a course.  Grabbing keyword from metadata or filtering through closed captioning is probably the most common method utilized.  Some companies have even captured the presentation slides from a video with OCR to discover text and extract accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that there is clearly a gap for the online streaming noncurated content in identifying and querying for events.&lt;/p&gt;
