&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver has gained a lot of recognition in regards to analyzing MLB stats and political forecasting, and now he has taken his talents to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/march-madness-predictions/&quot;&gt;NCAA March Madness bracket&lt;/a&gt;.  However there there are a lot of upsets in the bracket, so the record and stats alone don't tell the entire story.  Some methods place a particular emphasis on a certain spect, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sonnymoorepowerratings.com/m-basket.htm&quot;&gt;Moore ratings&lt;/a&gt; on recent performance.  There are adjustments made,
e.g. injuries, travel distance, tourney updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kentucky(8) only had a 4% chance of reaching the Championship, and Connecticut(7) had even less of a chance at 2%, with Florida being the only #1 seed to advance to the Final Four.
The selection committee seedings (RPI) didn't to some teams justice in the rankings, such as
Kentucky ranked as a #8 seed.  While Louisville had a good chance of repeating at 24%, it got
knocked out earlier, and 34-0 wichita State got knocked out by Kentucky in an earlier round as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's tough to predict the champions, who would have predicted #7 Seed UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
