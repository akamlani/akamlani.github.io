&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver has gained a lot of recognition in regards to analyzing MLB stats and political forecasting, and now he has taken his talents to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/march-madness-predictions/&quot;&gt;NCAA March Madness bracket&lt;/a&gt;.  However there there are a lot of upsets in the bracket, so the record and stats alone don't tell the entire story.  Some methods place a particular emphasis on a certain spect, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sonnymoorepowerratings.com/m-basket.htm&quot;&gt;Moore ratings&lt;/a&gt; on recent performance.  There are adjustments made,
e.g. injuries, travel distance, tourney updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kentucky(8) only had a 4% chance of reaching the Championship, and Connecticut(7) had even less of a chance at 2%, with Florida being the only #1 seed to advance to the Final Four.
The selection committee seedings (RPI) didn't to some teams justice in the rankings, such as
Kentucky ranked as a #8 seed.  While Louisville had a good chance of repeating at 24%, it got
knocked out earlier, and 34-0 wichita State got knocked out by Kentucky in an earlier round as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's tough to predict the champions, who would have predicted #7 Seed UConn.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;is innovation an overused word&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is a common term thrown around, does it still hold ground?  There is in reference to an article in wired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/11/innovation-the-most-important-and-overused-word-in-america/&quot;&gt;innovation the most important and overused keyword in america&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be innovative, it should be seen as a process, a repetitive process.  How do we learn to be innovative, creative, and forward thiking?  Well it probably doesn't help if we are not exposed to new environments, as this will not foster creativity.  We are creatures of habit, and so by nature we tend to perform the same acts over and over, as it is second nature.  We need to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I do agree the it is an overused word with those trying to stand out from the rest of the pack.  However our actions should speak louder than the words...&lt;/p&gt;
