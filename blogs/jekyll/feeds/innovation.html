&lt;p&gt;Innovation is a common term thrown around, does it still hold ground?  There is in reference to an article in wired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/11/innovation-the-most-important-and-overused-word-in-america/&quot;&gt;innovation the most important and overused keyword in america&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be innovative, it should be seen as a process, a repetitive process.  How do we learn to be innovative, creative, and forward thiking?  Well it probably doesn't help if we are not exposed to new environments, as this will not foster creativity.  We are creatures of habit, and so by nature we tend to perform the same acts over and over, as it is second nature.  We need to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
