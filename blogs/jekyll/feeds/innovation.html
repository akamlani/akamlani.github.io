   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;ideo tools we like&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Ideo and Ideo Labs.  Ideo labs recently published a couple articles regarding some
of their favorite building and prototyping tools in tools we like referenced &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.ideo.com/2014/02/12/tools-we-like/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.ideo.com/2014/02/12/tools-we-like-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Looks like they will be making &quot;Tools We Like&quot; a regular occurence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do like Foundation over Bootstrap, since it was designed with the nature of Responsive, rather
than later added as a feature.  I use it more for the grid layout, rather than all the other
bells and whistles.  A couple of the items on my list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daneden.me/toast/&quot;&gt;Daniel Eden's Toast&lt;/a&gt; for a bare-bones framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quojs.tapquo.com/&quot;&gt;Quo.js library&lt;/a&gt; yet to add gesturial interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xscopeapp.com/&quot;&gt;xScope&lt;/a&gt; for measuring pixels of assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to more editions, maybe for some of the hardware and data science prototyping
tools as well...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;is innovation an overused word&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is a common term thrown around, does it still hold ground?  There is in reference to an article in wired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/11/innovation-the-most-important-and-overused-word-in-america/&quot;&gt;innovation the most important and overused keyword in america&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be innovative, it should be seen as a process, a repetitive process.  How do we learn to be innovative, creative, and forward thiking?  Well it probably doesn't help if we are not exposed to new environments, as this will not foster creativity.  We are creatures of habit, and so by nature we tend to perform the same acts over and over, as it is second nature.  We need to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I do agree the it is an overused word with those trying to stand out from the rest of the pack.  However our actions should speak louder than the words...&lt;/p&gt;
